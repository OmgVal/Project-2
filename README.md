# GIF-tastic

Picture this, if "we heart it" and "giphy" had a baby. A place where you could just go and like as many gifs as you wanted. A sea of gifs. YOUR sea of gifs.

Now.. realistically you wouldnt make the sea to have "fun" but to pass time. You can favorite gifs and they will all be easily accessed via your profile.

Cool right? Yeah...probably not but at least you'll be able to see a bunch of entertaining gifs. üëçüèªü§ì
