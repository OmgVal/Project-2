## Description

What is GIF-tastic? Picture this, if "we heart it" and "giphy" had a baby. A place where you could just go and like as many gifs as you wanted. A sea of gifs. YOUR sea of gifs. 

![DancingBeach](./imgs/dancingBeach.gif)

Now.. realistically you wouldn't make the sea to have "fun" but to pass time. You can like gifs and they will all be easily accessed via your profile.

Cool right? Yeah...probably not but at least you'll be able to see a bunch of entertaining gifs. üëçüèªü§ì

# Post-Project Reflection:
Since completing the project I believe I have started noticing the best way I work/learn. On my pervious project I recall being extremely anxious and trying to avoid coding until I believed I "grasped it" using youtube/lecture recordings. I was panicking so much that I kept myself from actually coding out of self-doubt. A few days prior to our presentation day, once I finally started coding, I found myself create lines of code off things I had memorized.

For this reason, this time around I decided to avoid tutorials until I had ran through all possible solutions I could think of myself. Actually using my brain power. I also made sure to ask for help when needed to avoid getting stuck on an issue by trying to "do it all myself". I believe by doing this it helped me to begin to memorize javascript syntax more and start to feel more comfortable with it. Another hurdle I faced was learning Bootstrap. I recall fighting with myself because I kept trying to give up and return to using CSS directly because of how much I wanted to customize my layout and go all out. Eventually I decided the better move was going to be to try bootstrap regardless of how unfamiliar I was with it. I gave up my website design in order to gain knowledge on a topic that I knew was gonna benefit me in the long run.

Over all, I learned a lot from this project and although my design was more basic than I would have liked I'm still proud for challenging myself. I can't wait for the next one.
